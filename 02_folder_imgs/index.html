I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. You enjoyed that. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I will obey your orders. 

I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise.

###Week 5 - JS CS Week

This week is a challenging week for new learners. In order to continue to learn  JavaScript, we need to cover the hard basics. That means variables, conditionals and functions. 

This week will continue to teach how to add simple interactivity in addition to building understanding of JavaScript and jQuery.


The homework assignment for this week is to [re-create](Assignment) their work from the class weather widget app and create a city widget web application that takes a user's input and updates the page's background and images with assets given to students to reflect the input. 

###Final Project Milestone 1

By the end of week 5, you should have submitted a proposal and wireframes for your final project. Now, you'll need to write some pseudo code for the interactivity you would like to add. For this week, you should begin writing psuedo code and a draft of the HTML/CSS for your application - this should be turned into your instructor by the end of week 7.

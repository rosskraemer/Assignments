Jquery Review and Functions
FEWD
  Review
We started with our html and css
html added structure
css added style and layout
javascript lets us add fun things to our page or site

Loading of html page
browsers aren’t smart
draw out the 3 pages(html, css, js), show how they are loaded
they load the html page, which loads the css, and then it loads javascript
javascript program is run line by line
Important - javascript is loaded and run at the same time(see functions review)
When the browser loaded the page the JS was executed at the same time.

Selectors Review
we used selectors to select html elements
Syntax for selecting items?  (see functions review, select randomText)
jquery and selector.  selector was the same format we used for css
so, if we want to set the randomText elements color to blue, what did we do in css?
what do we do in javascript
show that it is executing at the same time as loading
just for fun.  fadeIn


Conditionals Review
when running a program we want to control what code gets executed
so we need to make decisions about it
we do tests using our symbols (===, !===, >, <)
Code inside braces is isolated from the rest of the code
let’s do a test for 1 number bigger than the other in functions file.
let add a branch to the conditional
we take and make a fork in the road of execution here
Let’s do blackout exercise from lesson 9 without interacting with the 

Variables Review
Remember that browsers aren’t smart
so we need to store info for later usage
metaphor - political note scandal
Let’s open scorekeeper and dissect the solution code
Since the program is loaded and run at the same time, we had to figure out a place to hold on to score
We used that score later on when we added to it.
We can store different things inside of our variables
numbers, strings, booleans

Let’s do blackout exercise from lesson 9 using a variable to store if the lights are on or off

Basic Functions
because the javascript is loaded when the browser loads things.   To add more interactivity or to react to things that happen.  we want to store that interactivity
just like a variable is set aside for later use
metaphor - political note scandal…run exposeScandal
a function is also set aside for later use
because it’s set aside for later use, it must be called
syntax for function
inside the braces that code is stored for later and not run on browser load
NOTE - we used function name(){}
the parens denote that we can send something in here
In groups of two complete the functions review code.
Talk through step by step what is happening when you create a function
Also talk through how the entire javascript is loaded and what you think is happening

Return Values from a function(02_return_values)
Since we set a function aside for later use we might want to make it more of a standalone thing
We had previously used functions to change text or html elements on the page
let’s take a look and walk through 02_return_values
let’s start at the end result and work our way backwards
What are the things we want to accomplish(pseudocode)

Passing values into a function(03_passing_variables)
parens after the name allow for things to be put in there
(numberOne, numberTwo)
 numberOne and numberTwo is the name used inside the function
walkthrough passing values to function
step by step.   handoff of the football from outside the function to inside the function with the name


Anonymous function
when we do things like react to events like click events, the function that gets called is called a callback function
what it means is after executing the method click, run the function given to it
we can shorten this with an anonymous function
where else have we seen this

exercise is assignment or cash register depending on time

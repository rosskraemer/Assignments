## Exercise 3 ##

### Boldy go with colors and nav ###

This exercise is for practicing adding colors and multiple css rules to an html element.  Use the same template from exercise 2.  Adding to it.

Please complete the following tasks:

- Style the main text using an rgba color of your choice
- Style the background of the paragraph using a hex color of your choice
- Add a font family of your choice to all paragraph elements
- Change the font-weight property of the paragraph to see what happens
- Add a nav section the top of the page with items "number one", "data", "doctor", "wil wheaton".  Style the nav section and one of the paragraphs with the same font size.  Hint:  you will need to add a class or id attribute to the paragraphs to identify them.  Also, you will combine selectors in one rule.

p, #firstParagraph {
 color: white;
 text-decoration: underline;
}
